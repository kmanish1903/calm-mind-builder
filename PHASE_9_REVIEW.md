## 2. Security Audit Results

### A. Supabase Security Scan

**Total Findings**: 3 (All WARN level, no CRITICAL issues)

#### Finding 1: Leaked Password Protection Disabled
- **Level**: WARN
- **Status**: USER ACTION REQUIRED
- **Description**: Password breach detection is currently disabled
- **Recommendation**: User should enable this in Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Providers → Email → Enable "Leaked Password Protection"
- **Impact**: Low - Does not affect core security but recommended for production

#### Finding 2: Crisis Events - No DELETE Policy
- **Level**: WARN
- **Status**: INTENTIONAL (HIPAA Compliance)
- **Justification**: Crisis event records should NEVER be deleted to maintain complete medical history
- **Current Policy**: Users can INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE their own crisis events
- **Recommendation**: NO CHANGE NEEDED - This is correct for HIPAA compliance

#### Finding 3: User Progress - No DELETE Policy
- **Level**: WARN
- **Status**: INTENTIONAL (HIPAA Compliance)
- **Justification**: Progress data should be preserved for treatment continuity
- **Current Policy**: Users can INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE their own progress records
- **Recommendation**: NO CHANGE NEEDED - This is correct for data integrity

### B. Row Level Security (RLS) Review

**All tables have proper RLS policies**:

1. **profiles** ✅
   - SELECT: Users can view their own profile
   - INSERT: Users can create their own profile
   - UPDATE: Users can update their own profile
   - DELETE: DISABLED (intentional - preserve user data)

2. **mood_entries** ✅
   - SELECT: Users can view their own entries
   - INSERT: Users can create their own entries
   - UPDATE: Users can update their own entries
   - DELETE: Users can delete their own entries

3. **daily_goals** ✅
   - SELECT: Users can view their own goals
   - INSERT: Users can create their own goals
   - UPDATE: Users can update their own goals
   - DELETE: Users can delete their own goals

4. **user_progress** ✅
   - SELECT: Users can view their own progress
   - INSERT: Users can create their own progress
   - UPDATE: Users can update their own progress
   - DELETE: DISABLED (intentional - preserve historical data)

5. **crisis_events** ✅
   - SELECT: Users can view their own events
   - INSERT: Users can create their own events
   - UPDATE: Users can update their own events
   - DELETE: DISABLED (intentional - HIPAA compliance)

**Conclusion**: All RLS policies are correctly configured for HIPAA compliance and data protection.

## 3. Code Quality & Optimization

### A. Production Console Logs
**Issue**: Console.log statements found in `src/main.tsx` for service worker debugging
**Recommendation**: Keep these as they're useful for PWA debugging and only log non-sensitive information

### B. Component Architecture
**Status**: GOOD
- Small, focused components
- Proper separation of concerns
- Custom hooks for state management (`useAuth`, `useMood`, `useGoals`)
- Reusable UI components from shadcn/ui

### C. Performance Optimizations
**Current State**:
- React Query for data fetching and caching
- Supabase real-time subscriptions ready
- Service worker for offline caching
- Lazy loading components where appropriate

**Recommendations**:
1. Consider memoization for expensive calculations in mood analysis
2. Implement virtual scrolling for large mood history lists
3. Optimize bundle size by reviewing unused dependencies

### D. TypeScript Coverage
**Status**: EXCELLENT
- All components properly typed
- Database types auto-generated from Supabase
- Custom interfaces for domain models
